Case Study for Customer Churn Prediction

 
## Purpose


Purpose: Tech-challenges for application for BNK

Customer churn also known as Customer turnover occurs when customers are stop doing business with a company or service from bank. Therefore, Understanding what keeps customer engageing is incredibly valuable for banks at the moment.in the meantime, I have tried to find relevant data set about Customer churn in Banking but I could not find any publically opened data set in banking. so, I choose a similar dataset(a longstanding telecom data )

In this notebook, you will explore a simple case study to show how supervised learning algorithms and its scientific libraries like sklearn, keras or tensorflow can be applied to predict churn
